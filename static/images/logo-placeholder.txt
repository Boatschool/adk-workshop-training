LOGO PLACEHOLDER

Place your organization's logo here as: logo.png

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Size: 200x50 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- File name: logo.png
- Location: static/images/logo.png

To use your logo:
1. Save your logo as static/images/logo.png
2. Update logo_url in training_portal.py if needed:
   "logo_url": "/static/images/logo.png"

If you don't have a logo, the portal will work fine without one -
it will simply hide the logo element and show just the organization name.
