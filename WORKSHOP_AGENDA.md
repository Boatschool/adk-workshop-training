### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Participants can't access Visual Builder
**Solution:** Have Python agent code ready as backup; troubleshoot during break

**Issue:** Google Cloud authentication problems
**Solution:** Pre-create demo accounts; use simulated tools that don't need cloud access

**Issue:** Wide range of skill levels
**Solution:** Buddy system; bonus challenges; instructor support

**Issue:** Specific use case questions beyond workshop scope
**Solution:** Capture for follow-up; schedule office hours; create parking lot
